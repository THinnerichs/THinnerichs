Hi there,

I am Tilman (@THinnerichs), PhD Student at STAR AI Lab and Algorithmics Group at TU Delft, Computer Scientist and 2 Meter Peter.

I am interested in program learning, neuro-symbolic proofs and reasoning, ontologies and logics, and their application to bioinformatics.

I'm currently reading, working and learning my way through Probabilistic (Logic) Programming and Inductive Logic Programming for Program Synthesis and their applications in the biomedical realm.
